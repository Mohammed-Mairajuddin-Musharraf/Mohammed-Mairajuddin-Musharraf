PWM - Pulse Width Modulation
Using digital control circuit that controls amount of power supplied to Anolog devices.
Ex: Analog devices(LED, Motor) when connected to digital pulse sees instantaneous voltage(GND,Vcc) levels, but on long run it sees average of voltage pulse for 1-cycle i.e., Avg. voltage = Ton * Vcc.
PWM is technique to control the pulse width of digital signals.
Improved PWM is technique to control both pulse width and frequency of pusle

Pulse frequency/Switching frequency is required becasue same PWM circuit can be used to control various analog devices. 

Design a digital circuit whose pulse width can be modified.
1-cylce can be divided into several parts/intervels, each part difines granularity of width that can be controlled which is based on resolution(no.of bits used to encode the pulse widht)
Ex: if 8-bit is used to encode pulse width then resolution of pulse width is 1/256

Circuit description:
PWM circuit output is 1-bit signals
if you need 50% duty cycle and no.of bits used to encode the pulse width is 8-bits then
00000000(sec) is start of the pulse and 11111111(sec) is end of pulse
for pulse to have 50% duty cycle, PWM out should be 1 for 256/2 (01111111) and PWM out should be 0 for 256/2 (01111111)
We need a 8-bit counter that starts counting from 00000000 to 11111111 and for every increment the counter compares the count value with value stored in 8-bit register.
Ex: For 50% duty cycle, PWM output will be high for 128 counts --> 0 to 127 and low for next 128 counts --> 128 to 255

LOGIC: if(duty_reg > count_reg)
        PWM_out <= 1'b1;
	   else
	    PWM_out <= 1'b0;

# PWM - Pulse Width Modulation

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique that uses digital control circuits to regulate the amount of power supplied to analog devices.

---

## Concept

- **Analog devices** (like LEDs, motors) when connected to a digital pulse see instantaneous voltage levels (`GND`, `Vcc`).
- Over time, they perceive the **average voltage** of the pulse for one cycle:

\[
V_{avg} = \frac{T_{on}}{T_{cycle}} \times V_{cc}
\]

- **PWM** controls the **pulse width** of digital signals.
- **Improved PWM** also controls both **pulse width** and **frequency** of the pulse.

---

## Why Pulse Frequency (Switching Frequency) Matters?

- The same PWM circuit can be used to control different analog devices.
- The switching frequency ensures device compatibility.

---

## Design Goal

Design a digital circuit whose pulse width can be modified.

- **1 cycle** can be divided into several intervals.
- Each interval defines the **granularity** of width control.
- Granularity depends on the **resolution** (number of bits used to encode the pulse width).

### Example

- If **8 bits** are used to encode pulse width:
  - Resolution = **1 / 256**
  - i.e., the duty cycle can be controlled in 1/256 steps.

---

## Circuit Description

- **PWM output** is a **1-bit signal**.
- Suppose duty cycle = **50%** and resolution = **8 bits**:

  - Counter range: `00000000` → `11111111` (0 to 255)
  - For 50% duty cycle:
    - PWM output = `1` for first 128 counts (`0 to 127`)
    - PWM output = `0` for next 128 counts (`128 to 255`)

### Logic

```verilog
if (duty_reg > count_reg)
    PWM_out <= 1'b1;
else
    PWM_out <= 1'b0;
Summary
PWM provides variable average voltage to analog devices.

The resolution depends on the bit-width of the counter.

Adjustable duty cycle and frequency make PWM versatile for controlling various analog devices like LEDs, motors, etc.


Would you like me to also add **a small Verilog code snippet** of a working 8-bit PWM module (counter + comparator) so the README looks more practical for GitHub?
